        <h1>Member Task Allocation</h1>
        Julian Tiu set up the initial interface including the window panel and the control panel
        <br /><br />
        Drew Carr and Alexandra were in charge of calculations for the differential drive.

        <h1>Meeting Log</h1>
        Most meetings happened informally throughout the two weeks of the project via Groupme. Julian began again with setting up the foundation for what was needed programming wise around Nov. 4th. He kept us updated on the progress.
        <br /><br />
        Afterwards more work was done to finish up the code and help with bugs by Alexandra and Drew in cooperation with Julian across Nov. 4 - 6th
        <br /><br />
        Report and logging happened throughout the course of the project by the remaining members.
